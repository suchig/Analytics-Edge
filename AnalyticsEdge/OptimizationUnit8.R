# Is it worth it to market the discount fares from JFK to DFW?
# Ans - No. American Airlines should not market the discount fares from JFK to DFW because the revenue does not increase at all by increasing the demand for these tickets.
# s it worth it to market the regular fares from JFK to LAX?
# Ans - No. American Airlines should not market the regular fares from JFK to LAX because even though the revenue increases, it does not exceed the costs.

# 150
# What is the minimum value your decision variables can be?
# 0
# 1.3 What is the estimated value of your Microsoft stock next year?
# 34.55 x (150 - x)
# 1.4 How much would you get in cash, after taxes and transaction costs, if you sell 50 shares of your Intel stock?
# Today's price = 50*23.67 = 1183.5. Original cost = 50*22.54 = 1127. Difference = 56.5, Capital Gain = 56.5*0.3 = 16.95, Trans cost = 0.1*1183.5=11.835, Actual cash = 1183.5-16.95-11.835 =1154.715
